Today, while travelling we often forget to plan out our vacations. This usually leads us to forget to take things, like the correct money, clothes and more, ending our vacation into one big mess. It often ends up worse if the travel is to a different place where you have no knowledge of anything. Tourism apps help users for planning travel, thus making their holidays more planned out and enjoyable. This report, proposes a web app, an attempt to organise your vacation in a foreign place with all the tools needed to stay in a place like that.
We named our application OutdOOrs to signify the problems faced when going out of a country youâ€™re familiar with. The Java-based application was created using various technologies which will be presented in the content soon.
         
         There are 3 main components to this project, the Currency Converter, the Expense Tracker and the Packing List.
